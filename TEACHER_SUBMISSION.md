    '"message":"' WS-AUTH-MESSAGE '",'
    '"timestamp":"' WS-CURRENT-TIME '"'

- `/cobol-services/financial-calc.cob` lines 98-101: Invalid calculation type
```cobol
READ USER-MASTER
    INVALID KEY
        MOVE "User not found" TO WS-AUTH-MESSAGE
        MOVE "FAILED" TO WS-AUTH-STATUS
    NOT INVALID KEY
        PERFORM CHECK-USER-STATUS
```
